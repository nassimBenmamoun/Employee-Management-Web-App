# Employee-Management-Web-App
This project involves the development of an application for managing employees. The application provides user authentication, allowing users to log in if they already have an account or sign up to create a new account. Once logged in, users can perform various operations related to employee management. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for a structured and organized implementation.

## Implemented Functionalities
 1. User Authentication
    - Login: Existing users can log in to the application using their credentials.
    - Sign Up: New users can create an account by providing the necessary information.
 2. Employee Management
    - Add Employee: Users can add new employees by entering their details.
    - Update Employee: Existing employee records can be modified with updated information.
    - Delete Employee: Users have the ability to remove employee records from the system.
    - Display Employees List: The application displays a list of all employees in a tabular format.
    - Search Employees: Users can search for employees by their first name or last name.

## Technologies Used
 - HTML: For creating the user interface and web pages.
 - Bootstrap: To enhance the design and responsiveness of the application.
